# List of TODOs

By requesting https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users, create and fill a table with three columns: 1) a TODO item, 2) the name of the user whom the item belongs to (the name should be a link to the user’s email address — use `a href="mailto:email@address.com"`), and 3) whether the item is completed.

Use `XMLHttpRequest` or, if you are comfortable with it, `fetch`.
